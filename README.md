# C I Toe

Students' project that incorporates computer vision and artificial intelligence to let people play Tic-Tac-Toe with a computer.

## Usage
Program uses your default camera. Prepare a tic-tac-toe board using thicc lines on a white background.
Our script assumes people are playing fair - any rule breaking moves will also break the program.

```python
python board_detection.py #to run the game 
```
Use circles for your moves, press 'enter' and after the program matches circles' positions, press `space` to generate AI's move. `q` to quit.

# C I Toe

Students' project that incorporates computer vision and artificial intelligence to let people play Tic-Tac-Toe with a computer.
## Prerequisites
Program uses your default camera. Prepare a tic-tac-toe board using thicc lines on a white background.


## Usage
Our script assumes people are playing fair - any rule breaking moves will also break the program.

```python
python board_detection.py #to run the main loop
```
Use circles for your moves, and after the program matches their positions, press `enter` to generate AI's move. `q` to quit.
